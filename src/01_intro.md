# Course Info

## Basics
* Title: Targeted Learning in Biomedical Big Data
* Faculty Instructor: Mark van der Laan
* Graduate Student Instructor: Nima Hejazi
* Day 01: Introduction to the Course
* Tuesday, 16 January 2018

## Logistics
* Public Health 290-011 (CCN: 42472)
* Lectures: TuTh 11:00A-12:30P
* Laboratory: W 2:00-3:00P
* Location: Mulford 230

# Format

## Flipped classroom
* Watch video lectures at home.
* Class time will be used for discussion and examples.
* Why? Engage with your peers and the instructor!

## Readings
* Readings from _Targeted Learning: Causal Inference for Observational and
    Experimental Data_ (MJ van der Laan and S Rose, 2011)
* Selections from the recent primary literature on Targeted Learning

## Laboratory
* Emphasizes the core tenets of computationally reproducible research
* Introduce software tools that will make implementing the theory we discuss
    possible

# Grading

## Assignments
* Between 3 and 5 project-style assignments, to be completed over the course of
    ~2-3 weeks each; weighted 40% cumulatively.
* Distributed/collected via GitHub Classroom
* All work must be completely computationally reproducible (i.e., not just
    the result of using tools for literate programming)
* Each assignment will (likely) involve implementing methodology, studying
        theory via simulations, and applied data analysis

## Project
* 30% Course Project - a substantial project to include some combination of
    theoretical work, simulation studies, and applied data analysis
    * Goal: Clearly state and solve a scientific problem by applying the
        statistical tools that we discuss
    * Welcome to use your own data, but must be willing to submit the data to
        the instructional staff to ensure that your work is reproducible
    * Deliverables: (1) Manuscript, (2) Scripts for any results reported, (3)
        Presentation at end of semester
    * Acceptable to work in small groups, depending on the final class size

## Participation
* 20% Participation - showing up and being prepared for / engaged in the course

## Attendance
* 10% Attendance - recorded at all meetings by the staff
