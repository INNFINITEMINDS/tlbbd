## Logistics

* Public Health 290-011 (CCN: 42472)
* Lectures: TuTh 11:00A-12:30P
* Laboratory: W 2:00-3:00P
* Location: Mulford 230

---

## Format

* "Flipped" classroom - watch lectures at home, discussion + examples in class
* Readings from _Targeted Learning: Causal Inference for Observational and
    Experimental Data_ (MJ van der Laan and S Rose, 2011) + selections from the
    primary literature
* Topics discussed in laboratory meetings will emphasize the core tenets of
    computationally reproducible research and introduce software tools that will
    make implementing the theory we discuss possible

---

## Grading

* 40% Assignments - between 3 and 5 project-style assignments, to be completed
    over the course of ~2-3 weeks each.
    * Distributed and collected via GitHub Classroom
    * All work must be completely computationally reproducible (i.e., not just
        the result of using tools for literate programming)
    * Each assignment will (likely) involve implementing methodology, studying
        the theoretical properties via simulations, and applied data analysis
* 30% Course Project - a substantial project to include some combination of
    theoretical work, simulation studies, and applied data analysis
    * Goal: Clearly state and solve a scientific problem by applying the
        statistical tools that we discuss
    * Welcome to use your own data, but must be willing to submit the data to
        the instructional staff to ensure that your work is reproducible
    * Deliverables: (1) Manuscript, (2) Scripts for any results reported, (3)
        Presentation at end of semester
* 20% Participation - showing up and being prepared for / engaged in the course
* 10% Attendance - recorded at all meetings by the staff
